spirit
- death -> ghost
- true death -> essence



the property of the essence
depends on the nature of the death

LOVE : birth/creation (+)
DOOM : destruction/death (-)
HATE : change/manipulation (o)

potions are
ingredients bound together by essence

essence can be used to bind resources together

potions can be analyzed by being broken down into the
essence + ingredients



i = ingredient

i + water = soup
soup + essence = potion
i + essence = dry potion (null effect)
dry potion + water = potion

potion + heat = dry potion
potion + freeze = solid potion (effective)
dry potion + heat = i
  essence can be burned away
dry potion + freeze = i + liquid essence
i + heat = ash
ash + heat = ash
ash + water = muck

potion + potion + essence = compound potion
  potions can be chained together by essence



should ingredients be reusable when a potion is broken down?

the effectiveness of a potion depends on how dense it is within the liquid

difference in boiling point
  distillation
difference in density
  filtration
