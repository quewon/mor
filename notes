to do
[ ] combination system that works
[x] bgs reflect content with overlap & opacity
[ ] potions + activation (experimentation)
[ ] interns
  interns that steal soup
  intro: dead intern in ur room

[ ] when placing on plate while scrolled the position is messed up

[?] numbers that go on forever sometimes result in inaccurate sizes
    eg. "2" becomes "1.99"
    how to recreate this bug:
      add up 6 water, 1 peach, 1 crumbs, and 1 love.
      split it once.
      split the thing you just split once more.
      put them all in the oven, and then add them up when they're ash.

    if i could check for numbers like this in normalizeDensities()...

    is my solution (_repeating) going to bite me in the ass i hope not


composition
freshness
temperature


spirit
- death -> ghost
- true death -> essence



the property of the essence
depends on the nature of the death

LOVE : birth/creation (+)
DOOM : destruction/death (-)
HATE : change/manipulation (o)

consuming (+) will heal you
consuming (-) will hurt you
consuming (o) will 



potions are
ingredients bound together by essence

essence can be used to bind resources together

potions can be analyzed by being broken down into the
essence + ingredients



i = ingredient

i + water = soup
soup + essence = potion
i + essence = dry potion (null effect)
dry potion + water = potion

potion + heat = dry potion
potion + freeze = solid potion (effective)
dry potion + heat = i
  essence can be burned away
dry potion + freeze = i + liquid essence
i + heat = ash
ash + heat = ash
ash + water = muck

potion + potion + essence = compound potion
  potions can be chained together by essence



should ingredients be reusable when a potion is broken down?

the effectiveness of a potion depends on how dense it is within the liquid

difference in boiling point
  distillation
difference in density
  filtration



ingredients

"the seeker" - a plant that can sniff things out
muck - muck
